This webpage provides code and related examples for DoAgram, a paper published in MSSP in 2024 [1].
There are no restrictions on using the codes, but please be sure to cite the source and references when using it officially or applying the idea.

## Highlights
- DoAgram is a visual representation method for multi-dimensional sound scene analysis.
- It represents the estimated localization result as RGB color channels.
- Any localization algorithm can be applied for DoAgram encoding in preprocessing.
- It is Human-interpretable dataset by using reference colormap.
- DoAgram can be used as a dataset with an image file.
