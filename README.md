# DoAgram


## Highlights
- DoAgram is proposed for a visual representation method for multi-dimensional sound scene analysis.
- It represents the estimated localization result as RGB color channels.
- Any localization algorithm can be applied for DoAgram encoding in preprocessing.
- It is Human-interpretable dataset by using reference colormap.
- DoAgram can be used as a dataset with an image file.
